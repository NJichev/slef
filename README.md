# Slef

The cure for your typos you've been waiting for.

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `slef` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:slef, "~> 0.1.0", only: :dev}]
end
```

## Usage

I haven't figured out a way to import the `Slef` module by default.
A simple way to use the library is just importing the module if available.

Inside bash:

```bash
echo "import_if_available Slef" >> ~/.iex.exs
```

This will create an `.iex.exs` file that gets loaded every time you enter the
console.
